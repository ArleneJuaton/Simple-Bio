I am not a Computer Science major and this is my first time coding but i've always wanted to learn how to code. 
A microbiologist by academic training and i am currently working in the BioTech industry. 
Currently deal with a lot of data in my work so i am interested in learning Python and SQL as well in order to make sense of multitude of data.
Dealing with multitude of data is one of the reason i wanted to learn how to code. Perhaps, become a Data Scientist later on.
I am also interested in building a website for possible future business venture(s).
Also, learn how to build games from scratch that would be enjoyable for me and others who might be interested in playing.
I first had the idea of becoming a software engineering when i got the chance to work from home.
Since software engineers are able to do their job with just a computer and an internet connection, i like the idea of having that flexibility.
I am also looking into getting a higher-paying job working at a tech company.
